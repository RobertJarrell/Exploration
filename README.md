This is a simple text based adventure console application

It starts with naming the player then sets you in hut allowing to later walk around inside the constraints of the 'scene' demensions
Eventually, material gathering and random encounters should be implemented
At the moment I got hung up on how I'd set up the data structures holding the scene parameters and where the primatives would live
